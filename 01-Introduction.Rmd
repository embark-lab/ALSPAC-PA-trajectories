Lauren's Intro:

Driven exercise (EDx), or exercise that has a compulsive quality, is a common symptom of eating disorders (ED) (@stiles-shieldsDrivenExerciseTreatmentSeeking2011a). When unable to exercise, individuals who experience EDx feel extreme guilt or anxiety for not exercising and may exercise even when injured or having prior engagements (@stiles-shieldsDrivenExerciseTreatmentSeeking2011a). The typical age of onset for EDx patterns occurs during adolescence, which is also the age when more than 25% of individuals engage in exercise for weight loss (EWL) (@schaumbergProspectiveAssociationsDriven2022a). Due to the overlap in development of EWL and DEx behaviors during late childhood, it is imperative to assess the possible precursor of engagement in physical activity in adolescence to DEx as an eating disorder symptom during early adulthood.
