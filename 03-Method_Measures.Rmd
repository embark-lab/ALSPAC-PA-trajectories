## Measures

### Socioeconomic Status (SES)

Measures of parent occupation were obtained for both mother and partner during child gestation. Parental occupations were then classified as unskilled(0), partly skilled (1), skilled manual (2), skilled non-manual (3), manegerial and technical (4), or professional (5). Of reported parent occupations, the highest reported occupation was used as a proxy for parent SES, to be treated as a continuous (0-5) covariate in analyses.

### Body Mass Index

Objective body mass index (BMI) was collected at face-to-face assessment (median ages: xx, 13.8, 15.5, 17.8, and 24.0) and self- or parent-report (median ages xx, xxx, xx, xx, xx. ). To maximize accuracy and minimize missing data, data from objective and self-report were integrated at ages 10, 14, 16, and 18 reflecting BMI assessments in the prior year, such that objective BMIz was used, if available, and self- or parent-report BMIz was used if objective data was not available (see Table \@ref(tab:x) for available data across timepoints). BMIz at age 10 was used as an analytic covariate and BMI/BMIz at later ages was used as a diagnostic criteria for AN (see more information in Table \@ref(tab:y) below). At ages 14-18, an underweight assignment was determined using age and gender BMIz score of \< -2 using World Health Organization (WHO) reference data and corresponding to grade 1 thinness [@coleBodyMassIndex2007]; at Age 24 underweight was assigned as BMI \< 18.5.

```{r bmi, include = FALSE}
# clinic <- sum(!is.na(demo_ed.f$bmi_clinic.13))
# no_clinic <- sum(is.na(demo_ed.f$bmi_clinic.13))
# best_avail <- sum(!is.na(demo_ed.f$bmi_bestavail.13))
# 
# missing_n <- 7688- best_avail
# pr_n <- best_avail-clinic
# missing_percent <- round ((7688 - best_avail)/7688*100 , 2)
# clinic_percent <-  round ((clinic)/7688*100, 2)
# pr_percent <- round((best_avail-clinic)/7688*100, 2)

```

### Exercise Measures

Questions related to maladaptive exercise were self-reported at ages 14, 16, 18, and 24 years. Questions were adapted from the Youth Risk Behavior Survelliance System [@kannYouthRiskBehavior1995].

#### Exercise for Weight Loss

At ages 14, 16, and 18 years, participants were asked if they exercised to lose weight or avoid gaining weight, with response options of: No(0), Yes-Sometimes(1), and Yes-Frequently(2).

At age 24, participants were asked the frequency with which they exercised to lose weight or avoid gaining weight, with response options of: Never, \<1x/mo, 1-3x/mo, 1-4x/wk, and 5 or more times per week. For the purposes of analysis, responses at age 24 were harmonized with age 14, 16, and 18. Responses of Never were binned as "No" (0); 1x/mo - \<1x/week were binned as 'Yes - Sometimes'(1), and 1x/wk or more as 'Yes - Frequently'(2). Once a week or more was chosen as the threshold for 'frequent' exercise for weight loss at age 24 to align with DSM-V diagnostic frequency thresholds for other eating disorder behaviors, such as binge eating and purging [@americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2013]. The primary derived outcome variable of analysis for exercise for weight loss is an ordinal variable, defined as 0 = No, 1 = Sometimes, and 2 = Frequently.

#### Maladaptive Exercise

Issues that are associated with exercise were also reported at ages 14,16, 18, and 24 years. At all assessment points, participants reported whether exercise interferes with work/school (14,16,18), or their daily routine (24). At ages 14 and 24, participants also reported whether they exercised to lose weight even when sick or injured. At ages 16 and 18 years, participants reported whether they felt guilty about missing an exercise session -- see Table \@ref(tab:tab2) . Responses options for exercise issues were 'No', 'yes - Sometimes', or 'Yes - Frequently'.

```{r tab2, echo = FALSE}
library(tibble)
x <- tibble(age = c(14,16,18,24), Interferes = c('x','x','x','x'), `Sick or Injured` = c('x',' ',' ', 'x'), Guilt = c('' ,'x','x', '')) 

knitr::kable(x, caption = 'Exercise Issues Assessed at Each Age')
```

Exercise issues are deemmed to be 'present' at each time point if an individual endorses: (1) exercise interfering with work/school sometimes or more OR frequent guilt when missing an exercise session at ages 16 and 18 years and (2) exercise interfering with work/school/daily routine sometimes or more OR exercising even when sick/injured sometimes or more at ages 14 and 24 years.

The presence of maladaptive exercise in this study was defined as exercising for weight loss **sometimes or frequently** and at least one **exercise issue** defined as present at each time point. Frequency of exercise for weight loss as sometimes or more was chosen for this definition as (1) existing literature suggests that frequency of exercise may be less important than cognitive features in defining exercise risk in the context of eating disorders [@adkinsDoesExcessiveCompulsive2005; @mondUpdateDefinitionExcessive2006] and (2) the nature of the epidemiological sample and the concomitant goals of this paper are such that we are interested in identifying early risk indicators, which may be best captured via a broad (vs. narrow) definition of maladaptive exercise. The primary variable to define maladaptive exercise was derived as described, resulting in a dichotomous outcome (0 = Absent, 1 = Present).

#### Exercise Gropus

Exericse groups over time are defined for descriptive analyses and transition states, replicating groups defined in @schaumbergProspectiveAssociationsDriven2022. Those who report no exericse for weight loss at each time point are placed in a 'No Exercise for Weight Loss' group, those who report exercise for weight loss at least sometimes, but do not meet criteria for maladaptive exercise are placed in an 'Exercise for Weight Loss' group, and those meeting maladaptive exercise criteria are placed in the 'Maladaptive Exercise' group.

#### Eating Disorder Behaviors

The measurement of eating disorder behaviors in adolescence captures a more complete range of behaviors beyond ED diagnosis. Eating disorder behaviors were assessed through questionnaires developed from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) at Waves 14+, 16+, 18+, and 24+ years. Participants were asked to consider the past year in their responses.

| Construct \| Timepoint \| Description \| \| \|\|-------\|-------\|----------------------------------------------\|-------\|-------\|
| Thin ideal internalization \| 14 \| Thin ideal internalization was measured at age 14 with the Ideal_Body Stereotype Scale_Revised (Stice, 1998). Adolescents responded to statements regarding appearance ideals rated on a five_point Likert scale from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree.' \| \| \|
| Body Satisfaction \| 14, 18, 24 \| The Body Satisfaction Scale was measured at 14, 18, and 24 and asked individuals to rate their satisfaction with their body parts on a 5-point Likert scale, from 'extremely satisfied' to 'extremely dissatisfied' with higher values indicating higher dissatisfaction. \| \| \|
| Pressure to lose weight \| 14 \| Pressure to lose weight was measured at age 14 with an adapted version of the Perceived Sociocultural Pressure Scale. Pressure to lose weight from friends, family, romantic partners, and the media was recorded. \| \| \|
| Pressure to increase muscle \| 14 \| Pressure to gain muscle was measured at age 14 with an adapted version of the Perceived Sociocultural Pressure Scale. Pressure to gain muscle from friends, family, romantic partners, and the media was recorded. \| \| \|
| Weight-related teasing \| . \| Adolescents were asked to report weight related teasing from peers and family members with five possible responses ranging from "never" to "at least once a week." \| \| \|
| Dieting \| 14, 16, 18 \| Participant dieting was measured at age 14, 16, and 18 and measured frequency during the past year YP went on a diet to lose weight/keep from gaining weight, length of diet, amount of weight lost, and amount of weight regained. \| \| \|
| External Eating \| 14 \| Participants completed a variation of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) at age 14. Dysfunctional eating patterns such as emotional eating, external eating, and restrained eating were assessed. \| \| \|
| Restrained Eating \| 14 \| Participants completed a variation of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) at age 14. Dysfunctional eating patterns such as emotional eating, external eating, and restrained eating were assessed. \| \| \|
| Emotional Eating \| 14 \| Participants completed a variation of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) at age 14. Dysfunctional eating patterns such as emotional eating, external eating, and restrained eating were assessed. \| \| \|
| Fear of Weight gain \| 14, 24 \| Participants asked the degree they worried about gaining a little weight (two pounds) in the past year. \| \| \|
| Maternal Dieting \| 14 \| Mothers were asked the frequency they tried to lose weight in the past year. \| \| \|
| Craving \| 16 \| Participants were asked the frequency of occurrence of strong cravings for food that they find hard to resist. \| \| \|
| Weight intentions \| 14, 18 \| Respondent asked about what they are trying to do with their weight. \| \| \|
| Weight Perception \| 14, 18 \| Participant notes their perception of their weight. \| \| \|
| Weight valuation \| 18 \| Participant notes the degree to which their weight has made a difference to how they feel about themselves. \| \| \|
| Feeling fat \| 24 \| Participant notes the frequency that they have felt fat in the past year. \| \| \|
| Weight/Shape concern \| 14 \| Weight and shape concern at age 14 was assessed using a 4 item questionnaire adapted from the McKnight Risk Factor Survey. \| \| \|

### Physical Activity

#### Accelerometers

Physical activity data was captured using the Actigraph^tm^ accelerometer, which is often used in child physical activity studies. Participants were instructed to wear accelerometers around the waist just above their right hip for the duration of the tracking period. Accelerometer data was collected at the following four time points. At ages 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5, during a clinic visit, young people were asked to wear the accelerometer for 7 days, beginning the day after clinic attendance [@mattocksUseAccelerometersLarge2008]. At age 24 participants were asked to wear accelerometers for four days beginning the day after clinic attendance [@troianoPhysicalActivityUnited2008].

#### CPM

Accelerometer data was used to extract total physical activity which was measured as the total counts per minute (CPM) over the period of valid recording. Associations with total physical activity are usually calculated per 100 cpm as this difference is of a similar order to the differences observed between males and females in these data.

#### MVPA

Moderate to Vigerous Physical Activity (MVPA) measures the average amount of time spent above a CPM cutoff, these cutoff points differ by age groups. At ages 11.5, 13.5 and 15.5 A value of \>= 3600 cpm was originally used to define MVPA at the time of the data collection [@mattocksUseAccelerometersLarge2008]. More recently, following Evenson et. al. [@evensonCalibrationTwoObjective2008], who calculated a lower cutpoint of \>=2296. Both sets of data were included in analysis. At age 24 MVPA cutoff was established at \>2020 cpm [@troianoPhysicalActivityUnited2008].

#### Valid Days

Valid Days are calculated using a cutoff of minutes per day that an accelerometer was worn. For ages 11.5-15.5 a cutoff of \>=600 minutes per day was used. At age 24 Valid Days were operationalised as a wear time of at least 500 minutes, after excluding intervals of \>60 minutes with zero counts.

### Eating Disorder Diagnoses

Eating disorder diagnoses (AN, BN,BED, BN-Spectrum [Purging disorder and subclinical BN], BED-spectrum [subclinical BED], and Restrictive spectrum [ED cognitions and restrictive ED behaviors in the absence of regular binge eating, purging, or low weight]) were derived at each age using best available measures and following steps outlined in @micaliAdolescentEatingDisorders2015, with minor changes (low-weight was defined as BMIZ \< -1.0 at ages 14 and 16 years; additional cognitive measures added to criteria as available; subclinical and OSFED categories collapsed to reflect BN, BED, and Restrictive Spectrum ED pathology). Scoring algorithms reflect DSM-5 criteria aligned as well as possible with available data that can be harmonized across assessment points [@americanpsychiatricassociationDiagnosticStatisticalManual2013]. While the majority of ED cognitions and behaviors are self-reported, parent-report of restrictive eating was included as an indicator at ages 14 and 16 years as adolescents tend to under-report AN symptoms [@houseDiagnosingEatingDisorders2008]. Table X shows the full criteria used for each diagnosis.

Diagnoses were assessed at Waves14+, 16+, 18+, and 24+. Excessive exercise, which is used as criteria for an AN and OSFED diagnoses, was assigned to the adolescent if they found themselves lacking time to do schoolwork due to engaging in exercise, exercising when sick or injured, and feeling guilt when unable to exercise.
