  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The criteria in the 4th ed. of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association) for bulimia nervosa include "excessive exercise" as an inappropriate compensatory behavior, suggesting that it is the quantity of the physical activity that is symptomatic, rather than its quality. The current study evaluated the hypothesis that psychological commitment to exercise (compulsive quality) will be more predictive of disordered eating attitudes and behaviors than the amount of time devoted to exercise (excessive quantity). METHOD: Female (n = 162) and male (n = 103) undergraduates completed the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) subscales, the Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire (OEQ), and questions to assess the duration and frequency of exercise. RESULTS: Using multivariate analysis, the OEQ score was a positive predictor of disordered eating attitudes and behaviors, and exercise time was a negative predictor. DISCUSSION: "Compulsive" may be a better description than "excessive" in characterizing exercise as a symptom of bulimia nervosa.},

  abstract = {Rationale Body dissatisfaction is prevalent among teenagers, and may influence the uptake of risky health behaviours. Objective The study assessed the influence of body dissatisfaction on smoking, cannabis use, drug use, self-harm, gambling, and drinking and the mediating role of disordered eating in a population-based sample of British adolescents. Method Participants were 2634 females and 1684 males from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Logistic regression was used to test if body dissatisfaction at 14 years old predicted the onset of risky health behaviours at 21 years old. Mediation analysis tested the mediating role of disordered eating at 16 years old on each risky health behaviour. Results Among females, body dissatisfaction predicted smoking (OR\,=\,1.40, 95\% CI\,=\,1.15, 1.72), cannabis use (OR\,=\,1.20, 95\% CI\,=\,1.00, 1.43), drug use (OR\,=\,1.51, 95\% CI\,=\,1.20, 1.90), self-harm (OR\,=\,1.44, 95\% CI\,=\,1.13, 1.84) and high-risk drinking (OR\,=\,1.41, 95\% CI\,=\,1.10, 1.80). Disordered eating symptoms had mediating effects on some behaviours. Among males, body dissatisfaction predicted smoking (OR\,=\,1.44, 95\% CI\,=\,1.14, 1.81) and no effect of disordered eating was found on any risky health behaviour. Conclusions This is the first prospective study to demonstrate that body dissatisfaction in adolescence predicts the occurrence of several risky health behaviours, and elucidates the mediating role of disordered eating. The findings highlight that body dissatisfaction is a public health concern. Early interventions to promote body satisfaction may reduce the prevalence of later risky health behaviours.},

This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

Sexual orientation was assessed at 16 years. Eating disorder symptoms were assessed at 14 and 16 years. Multivariable regression models (adjusting for BMI, ethnicity, socioeconomic status) examined associations between sexual orientation and (1) odds of past-year purging and binge eating, and (2) mean differences in body dissatisfaction, pressure to increase muscularity (boys only), and Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire subscales. At age 14, gay and bisexual boys and mostly heterosexual girls reported greater body dissatisfaction than their same-gender heterosexual peers. All sexual minority boys and mostly heterosexual girls reported greater mean dysfunctional eating behaviors than their same-gender heterosexual peers. At age 16, gay and bisexual boys had 12.5 times the odds of heterosexual boys of binge eating; mostly heterosexual boys had over three times the odds of reporting binge eating. Sexual minority girls had over twice the odds of heterosexual girls of purging and binge eating. By mid-adolescence, sexual minority youth in the UK had elevated risk for eating disorder symptoms, suggesting the need for early prevention efforts.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exercise is known to be associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes, but its association with mental health remains unclear. We aimed to examine the association between exercise and mental health burden in a large sample, and to better understand the influence of exercise type, frequency, duration, and intensity. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we analysed data from 1 237 194 people aged 18 years or older in the USA from the 2011, 2013, and 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System survey. We compared the number of days of bad self-reported mental health between individuals who exercised and those who did not, using an exact non-parametric matching procedure to balance the two groups in terms of age, race, gender, marital status, income, education level, body-mass index category, self-reported physical health, and previous diagnosis of depression. We examined the effects of exercise type, duration, frequency, and intensity using regression methods adjusted for potential confounders, and did multiple sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: Individuals who exercised had 1.49 (43.2\%) fewer days of poor mental health in the past month than individuals who did not exercise but were otherwise matched for several physical and sociodemographic characteristics (W=7.42 x 10(10), p{$<$}2.2 x 10(-16)). All exercise types were associated with a lower mental health burden (minimum reduction of 11.8\% and maximum reduction of 22.3\%) than not exercising (p{$<$}2.2 x 10(-16) for all exercise types). The largest associations were seen for popular team sports (22.3\% lower), cycling (21.6\% lower), and aerobic and gym activities (20.1\% lower), as well as durations of 45 min and frequencies of three to five times per week. INTERPRETATION: In a large US sample, physical exercise was significantly and meaningfully associated with self-reported mental health burden in the past month. More exercise was not always better. Differences as a function of exercise were large relative to other demographic variables such as education and income. Specific types, durations, and frequencies of exercise might be more effective clinical targets than others for reducing mental health burden, and merit interventional study.

To date, no comprehensive theoretical model exists to describe pathological exercise in the context of AN, and as such, few treatments are effective at promoting direct and sustained pathological exercise extinction. Using a framework put forth by Wise \& Koob (2014), debating the relative importance of positive and negative reinforcement in substance use, we present three hypotheses of behavioral reinforcement of exercise, encompassing biological, psychological, and environmental influences. Specifically, we argue that exercise is positively reinforced through receipt of biological and behavioral rewards, negatively reinforced through avoidance of aversive emotions, and that these two systems work in tandem over time to engrain pathological exercise as a habit. We then present suggestions for testing each of these hypotheses as future directions for the field.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed at assessing the prevalence of compulsive exercising to control shape and weight in eating disorders (EDs) and its relationship with treatment outcome. METHOD: Compulsive exercising to control shape and weight, defined according to a modified version of the Intense Exercising to Control Shape or Weight section of the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), was assessed in 165 consecutive ED inpatients entering a protocol based on the transdiagnostic cognitive behavior theory and treatment of EDs. Baseline assessment also included anthropometry, the global EDE interview, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Eating Disorders Inventory-Perfectionism Scale, and the Temperament and Character Inventory. RESULTS: Of the patients, 45.5\% were classified as compulsive exercisers, the prevalence being highest (80\%) in restricting-type anorexia nervosa (AN), lowest in EDs not otherwise specified (31.9\%), and intermediate in binge/purging AN (43.3\%) and in purging-type bulimia nervosa (39.3\%). Compulsive exercising to control shape and weight was independently predicted by the EDE restraint score (odds ratio, 1.32; 95\% confidence interval, 1.06-1.64; P = .014) after adjustment for ED; the total amount of exercise was associated with EDE restraint, as well as with the Temperament and Character Inventory reward dependence. At follow-up, an improved EDE global score was predicted by lower baseline values, higher baseline STAI and STAI improvement, and lower amount of exercise in the last 4 weeks. Voluntary treatment discontinuation was not predicted by baseline exercise. DISCUSSION: Compulsive exercising to control shape and weight is a behavioral feature of restricting-type AN, associated with restraint and temperament dimensions, with influence on treatment outcome.},

We studied the trajectories of their development in non-binge eating and non-purging girls during early adolescence. Using a longitudinal design, we assessed 564 girls six times over the three years of middle school (grades 6 through 8) and developed trajectories specifying different developmental patterns in relation to the behaviors. Prior to this period, when the girls were in 5th grade (elementary school), we assessed risk factors to predict girls' subsequent trajectory group membership. Compensatory exercise trajectory groups included a non-engagement group, a group that increased in the behavior, and a group that decreased in the behavior. There were two fasting trajectory groups, one consistently engaging in the behavior and the other consistently not. Elementary school levels of depression, eating expectancies, and thinness expectancies predicted subsequent trajectory group membership. Risk for compensatory exercise and fasting should be evaluated as early as in 5th grade. Targeted interventions should focus on girls in late elementary school or middle school, as this appears to be a critical developmental and maintenance period for compensatory exercise and fasting behavior.},

Hospitalized eating disordered patients and an age-matched control group were assessed. Historical and current physical activity data were collected. An in-depth interview was also conducted to ascertain the age of onset of the diagnostic symptoms for eating disorders, and to determine whether: (               i               ) exercising predated dieting; (               ii               ) patients had been involved in competitive athletics; (               iii               ) exercise was excessive; and (               iv               ) weight loss was inversely related to level of exercise. The results indicated that patients were more physically active than controls from adolescence onwards,               and               prior to the onset of the primary diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. A content analysis of the interview data indicated that 78\% of patients engaged in excessive exercise, 60\% were competitive athletes prior to the onset of their disorder, 60\% reported that sport or exercise pre-dated dieting, and 75\% claimed that physical activity levels steadily increased during the period when food intake and weight loss decreased the most. Together our results suggest that overactivity should not be routinely viewed as a secondary symptom in anorexia nervosa, equivalent to other behaviours. For a number of anorexic women, sport/exercise is an integral part of the pathogenesis and progression of self-starvation.},

  abstract = {Self-determination theory (SDT) is an empirically based theory of human motivation, development, and wellness. The theory focuses on types, rather than just amount, of motivation, paying particular attention to autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and amotivation as predictors of performance, relational, and well-being outcomes. It also addresses the social conditions that enhance versus diminish these types of motivation, proposing and finding that the degrees to which basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are supported versus thwarted affect both the type and strength of motivation. SDT also examines people's life goals or aspirations, showing differential relations of intrinsic versus extrinsic life goals to performance and psychological health. In this introduction we also briefly discuss recent developments within SDT concerning mindfulness and vitality, and highlight the applicability of SDT within applied domains, including work, relationships, parenting, education, virtual environments, sport, sustainability, health care, and psychotherapy.

Specifically, during the aging process, physical exercise might represent a potential adjunctive treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment, helping delay the onset of neurodegenerative processes. Even though exercise itself might act as a stressor, it has been demonstrated that it reduces the harmful effects of other stressors when performed at moderate intensities. Neurotransmitter release, neurotrophic factor and neurogenesis, and cerebral blood flow alteration are some of the concepts involved. In this review, the potential effects of exercise on the aging process and on mental health are discussed, concerning some of the recent findings on animal and human research. The overwhelming evidence present in the literature today suggests that exercise ensures successful brain functioning.},

Various underlying causes of LEA have been reported, including disordered eating behavior (DE), but studies investigating the association with exercise addiction and food intolerances are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this crosssectional study was to investigate the association between DE, exercise addiction and food intolerances in athletes at risk of LEA compared to those with low risk. Female endurance athletes, 18\textendash 35 years, training {$\geq$}5 times/week were recruited in Norway, Sweden, Ireland, and Germany. Participants completed an online-survey comprising the LEA in Females Questionnaire (LEAF-Q), Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), and questions regarding food intolerances. Of the 202 participants who met the inclusion criteria and completed the online survey, 65\% were at risk of LEA, 23\% were at risk of exercise addiction, and 21\% had DE. Athletes at risk of LEA had higher EDE-Q and EAI scores compared to athletes with low risk. EAI score remained higher in athletes with risk of LEA after excluding athletes with DE. Athletes at risk of LEA did not report more food intolerances (17 vs. 10\%, P = 0.198), but were more frequently reported by athletes with DE (28 vs. 11\%, P = 0.004). In conclusion, these athletes had a high risk of LEA, exercise addiction, and DE. Exercise addiction should be considered as an additional risk factor in the prevention, early detection, and targeted treatment of RED-S among female endurance athletes.},

These women have been followed over the last 19\textendash 22 years and have completed up to 20 questionnaires, have had detailed data abstracted from their medical records and have information on any cancer diagnoses and deaths through record linkage. A follow-up assessment was completed 17\textendash 18 years postnatal at which anthropometry, blood pressure, fat, lean and bone mass and carotid intima media thickness were assessed, and a fasting blood sample taken. The second follow-up clinic, which additionally measures cognitive function, physical capability, physical activity (with accelerometer) and wrist bone architecture, is underway and two further assessments with similar measurements will take place over the next 5 years. There is a detailed biobank that includes DNA, with genome-wide data available on {$>$}10\,000, stored serum and plasma taken repeatedly since pregnancy and other samples; a wide range of data on completed biospecimen assays are available.

There is little literature, however, examining the relationship between compensatory exercise and thinness expectancies. The goal of the current study was to examine whether thinness expectancies contribute significant variance in the endorsement of excessive exercise over and above binge eating, restraint, and shape and weight concerns. A total of 677 undergraduate women (mean age=18.73) completed self-report measures of thinness expectancies and eating disorder symptoms (TREI and EDE-Q). There was a significant association between thinness expectancies and frequency of compensatory exercise behavior. Restraint and subjective binge episodes accounted for significant variance in compensatory exercise. Frequency of objective binge episodes did not, nor did endorsement of thinness expectancies. These findings suggest a potential profile of individuals engaging in compensatory exercise as individuals who actively restrict their diets, feel as if they have binged when they violate those restrictions, and feel the need to excessively exercise to compensate for the subjective binges.},

  author = {Gordon, Max},

  month = jun,
  abstract = {A transition between states - the above is a simulation of before and after surgery where I've highlighted the large proportion that doesn't improve in the moderate group. As an orthopaedic surgeon I'm often interested in how a patient is doing after surgery compared to before. I call this as a transition between states, e.g. severe pain to moderate pain, and in order to better illustrate these transitions I've created something that I call a transition plot. It's closely related to the plotMat for plotting networks but aimed at less complex relations with only a one-way relation between two groups of states. This project started by me posting a question on Stack Overflow, the answers were (as always) excellent, but didn't really satisfy my needs. What I wanted was a graphically appealing plot that I could control in extreme detail. Thanks to Paul Murrell's excellent grid package I was able to generate a truly customizeable transition plot. In this post I'll give a short introduction with examples to what you can do with the transitionPlot()-function. I'll try to walk you through simple transitions to more complex ones with group proportions and highlighted arrows. Simulate some data To illustrate a simple example we'll generate some data, imagine having a questionnaire for pre- and postoperative pain graded none, moderate, or major. We have the two variables in our data set, and to see the relation we just do a three-by-three table: library(Gmisc) library(Gmisc) \# Generate some fake data set.seed(9730) b4 Transitions None Moderate Major None 13 33 8 Moderate 50 107 30 Major 78 131 50 Simple example This is interpretable, but understanding the flow can be challenging and time-consuming. Visualizing it using the transition plot gives a quick and more intuitive understanding: transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx) Here you can see the thick lines representing the transition from that particular group into the next. So far I've used the graph for the same measure on left and right side but I guess your imagination sets the limit. It can just as well be two or more treatment arms with some discrete outcomes. Simple with a twist In my previous post I documented how I created an arrow that allows perfect control over start, stop and width. Another annoying detail in the default bezier line, is that the arrows are perpendicular to each box, thus not following the line contour as expected. If we change the arrow type to my alternative arrow we get a nicer plot: \# Note that when using my arrow type you need to specify exact unit width \# since I wasn't certain how the lwd should be translated. transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "simple", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Note that I've also added a white background to each arrow in order to visually separate the arrows (the overlay order can be customized with the overlap\_order parameter). To further enhance the transition feeling I have added the option of a color gradient. To do this you need to specify arrow\_type = ``gradient'': \# Note that when using my arrow type you need to specify exact unit width \# since I wasn't certain how the lwd should be translated. transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) More complex coloring Additionally you can choose different colors for your boxes: library(RColorBrewer) transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, txt\_start\_clr = "black", txt\_end\_clr = "black", fill\_start\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Pastel1"), fill\_end\_box = brewer.pal(n = 6, name = "Pastel1")[4:6], overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Split boxes into proportions Sometimes you might want to split the color of each box into two colors, illustrating a proportion, for instance if we do wrist fracture surgery it might be interesting to explore if the left:right ratio differs. Note that the gradient color is a blend between the two proportions: transitionPlot(transition\_mtrx, box\_prop = cbind(c(0.3, 0.7, 0.5), c(0.5, 0.5, 0.4)), txt\_start\_clr = c("black", "white"), txt\_end\_clr = c("black", "white"), fill\_start\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Paired")[1:2], fill\_end\_box = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Paired")[1:2], overlap\_add\_width = 1.3, type\_of\_arrow = "gradient", min\_lwd = unit(2, "mm"), max\_lwd = unit(10, "mm")) Highlighting certain arrows Another interesting option may be to highlight a certain transition: arr\_clrs Summary Even though it may seem like a very simple plot, after some tweaking I believe the data-per-ink ratio turns out quite OK. I hope you'll find it as useful as I have. As always, don't hesitate to comment. The function transitionPlot is included in my Gmisc-package.},

The primary aim of the present study was to quantify the incidence of overweight and obesity throughout childhood and adolescence in a large contemporary cohort of English children (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC; children born 1991\textendash 1992). A secondary aim was to examine the persistence of overweight and obesity. Methods Longitudinal data on weight and height were collected annually from age 7\textendash 15years in the entire ALSPAC cohort (n=4283), and from 3 to 15years in a randomly selected subsample of the cohort (n=549; `Children in Focus' CiF). Incidence of overweight and obesity (BMI (Body mass index) at or above the 85th and 95th centiles relative to UK reference data) was calculated. Risk ratios (RR) for overweight and obesity at 15years based on weight status at 3, 7, and 11years were also calculated. Results In the entire cohort, four-year incidence of obesity was higher between ages 7 and 11years than between 11 and 15years (5.0\% vs 1.4\% respectively). In the CiF sub-sample, four-year incidence of obesity was also highest during mid-childhood (age 7\textendash 11years, 6.7\%), slightly lower during early childhood (3\textendash 7years, 5.1\%) and lowest during adolescence (11\textendash 15years 1.6\%). Overweight and obesity at all ages had a strong tendency to persist to age 15years as indicated by risk ratios (95\% CI (Confidence interval)) for overweight and obesity at 15years from overweight and obesity (relative to healthy weight status) at 3years (2.4, 1.8\textendash 3.1), 7years (4.6, 3.6\textendash 5.8), and 11years (9.3, 6.5\textendash 13.2). Conclusion Mid\textendash late childhood (around age 7\textendash 11years) may merit greater attention in future obesity prevention interventions.},

For example, the progression of chronic diseases is often described by stages of severity, and the state of the patient may only be known at doctor or hospital visits.

In this paper we present a type of lasagne plot showing changes in categorical variables for participants measured at regular intervals over time and propose statistical models to estimate distributions of marginal and transitional probabilities. Methods: The plot uses stacked bars to show the distribution of categorical variables at each time interval, with different colours to depict different categories and changes in colours showing trajectories of participants over time. The models are based on nominal logistic regression which is appropriate for both ordinal and nominal categorical variables. To illustrate the plots and models we analyse data on smoking status, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity level from a longitudinal study on women's health. To estimate marginal distributions we fit survey wave as an explanatory variable whereas for transitional distributions we fit status of participants (e.g. smoking status) at previous surveys. Results: For the illustrative data the marginal models showed BMI increasing, physical activity decreasing and smoking decreasing linearly over time at the population level. The plots and transition models showed smoking status to be highly predictable for individuals whereas BMI was only moderately predictable and physical activity was virtually unpredictable. Most of the predictive power was obtained from participant status at the previous survey. Predicted probabilities from the models mostly agreed with observed probabilities indicating adequate goodness-of-fit. Conclusions: The proposed form of lasagne plot provides a simple visual aid to show transitions in categorical variables over time in longitudinal studies. The suggested models complement the plot and allow formal testing and estimation of marginal and transitional distributions. These simple tools can provide valuable insights into categorical data on individuals measured at regular intervals over time.},

The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health risk behaviors among youth and youth adults: behaviors that contribute to unintentional and intentional injuries, tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, sexual behaviors, dietary behaviors, and physical activity. The YRBSS includes a national, school-based survey conducted by CDC and state and local school-based surveys conducted by state and local education agencies. This report summarizes results from the national survey, 24 state surveys, and nine local surveys conducted among high school students during February through May 1993. In the United States, 72\% of all deaths among school-age youth and young adults are from four causes: motor vehicle crashes, other intentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the 1993 YRBSS suggest many high school students practice behaviors that may increase their likelihood of death from these four causes: 19.1\% rarely or never use a safety belt, 35.3\% had ridden during the 30 days preceding the survey with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, 22.1\% had carried a weapon during the 30 days preceding the survey, 80.9\% ever drank alcohol, 32.8\% ever used marijuana, and 8.6\% had attempted suicide during the 12 months preceding the survey.

Standard approaches address this issue by means of generalized estimating equations or generalized linear mixed models with logistic links. Using an empirical example and simulated data, we show (1) that cross-level product terms from these models can produce misleading results with respect to whether the within-person rate of change varies across levels of a dichotomous between-person factor; and (2) that subgroup differences in the rate of change should be assessed on an additive scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the probability of disease) rather than on a multiplicative scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the odds of disease). Because usual approaches do not provide a significance test for whether the rate of additive change varies across levels of a between-person factor, sample differences in the rate of additive change may be due to sampling error. We illustrate how standard software can be used to estimate and test whether additive changes vary across levels of a between-person factor.},

  abstract = {Objective Eating-related fear and anxiety are hallmark symptoms of eating disorders (EDs). However, it is still unclear which fears are most important (e.g., food, weight gain), which has practical implications, given treatments for eating-related fear necessitate modifications based on the specific fear driving ED pathology. For example, exposure treatments should be optimized based on specific fears that maintain pathology. The current study (N = 1,622 combined clinical ED and undergraduate sample) begins to answer questions on the precise nature of ED fears and how they operate with other ED symptoms. Method We used network analysis to create two models of ED fears and symptoms. The first model consisted of ED fears only (e.g., fears of food, fears of weight gain) to identify which fear is most central. The second model consisted of ED fears and ED symptoms to detect how ED fears operate with ED symptoms. Results We found fear of disliking how one's body feels due to weight gain, disliking eating in social situations, feeling tense around food, fear of judgment due to weight gain, and food anxiety were the most central ED fears. We also identified several bridge symptoms between ED fears and symptoms. Finally, we found that the most central ED fears predicted excessive exercise at two-month follow-up. Discussion These data support the idea that consequences (i.e., judgment) associated with fears of weight gain and interoceptive fears are the most central ED fears. These data have implications for the future development of precision interventions targeted to address ED-related fear.},

  abstract = {Compulsive exercise is a condition described since 1970s. It is characterized by a craving for physical training, resulting in uncontrollable excessive exercise behavior with harmful consequences, such as injuries and impaired social relations. It has not been accepted as a mental disorder in either International Classification of Diseases or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The aim of this literature review was to critically examine the research on links (comorbidity), risks (negative consequences), and challenges faced (problems in a treatment context). This review found that compulsive exercise is associated with eating disorder pathology, perfectionism, neuroticism, narcissism, and obsessive compulsive traits. The most prominent negative consequences were injuries, social impairment, and depression, but more research is needed to uncover the potential dysfunction resulting from compulsive exercise. As the condition is not recognized as a psychiatric disorder, studies on treatment interventions are sparse. Problems with compliance have been reported; therefore, motivational interviewing has been proposed as a treatment approach, in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy. This review summarizes and discusses findings on links/comorbidity, risks/negative consequences, and treatment challenges. We suggest that future studies should pay attention to both prevention and counseling in sports settings, where compulsive exercise appears, as the condition may be associated with \-harmful consequences.},

METHOD: Self-report measures of frequency of exercise, obligatory exercise and motivation for exercise, and of eating disorder psychopathology and QOL, were completed by 3,472 women aged 18-42 years who engaged in regular exercise. RESULTS: The extent to which exercise is intended to influence weight or shape and the degree to which guilt is experienced when exercise is postponed were the exercise variables most strongly associated with elevated levels of eating disorder psychopathology and reduced QOL. Subgroups of participants who reported exercising solely for weight and shape reasons (n = 322 [9.3\%]), intense guilt after postponement of exercise (n = 136 [3.9\%]), or both (n = 116 [3.3\%]), had markedly elevated levels of eating disorder psychopathology. There was no association between excessive exercise and reduced QOL after the effects of eating disorder psychopathology were statistically controlled. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that exercise is excessive when its postponement is accompanied by intense guilt or when it is undertaken solely to influence weight or shape. Operational definitions of excessive exercise might usefully include reference to these terms. The findings may also be of benefit in informing the content of prevention programs, which address dysfunctional exercise behavior. Excessive exercise is unlikely to be associated with impairment in psychosocial functioning in the absence of eating disorder psychopathology. It may, however, be a useful indicator of such psychopathology.},

This prompted a large-scale and systematic examination of the impact of CE in a representative ED sample. Methods: CE was examined in over 9000 female and male patients from a clinical ED database (covering out-patient, day and/or residential treatment) with respect to prevalence, ED diagnosis, ED symptoms, clinical features, patient characteristics, and outcome at 1-year follow-up. Relationships between changes in CE behavior and remission were also examined. Results: CE was a transdiagnostic symptom, present in nearly half of all patients (48\%). It was associated with greater overall ED pathology, particularly dietary restraint, and negative perfectionism. Initial CE did not impact remission rate, but patients continuing or starting CE during treatment had considerably lower remission rates compared to patients who never engaged in, or ceased with, CE. Results were comparable for females and males. Conclusions: At baseline, there were few differences between patients with and without CE, except a somewhat higher symptom load for patients with CE, and CE did not predict ED outcome. However, how CE developed during treatment to 1-year follow-up considerably impacted remission rates. We strongly recommend CE to be systematically assessed, addressed, and continuously evaluated in all ED patients seeking treatment.},

Results showed the expected relations among the SDT variables, as well as positive relations of psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivation to beneficial health outcomes.

Psychosocial factors may put people at greater risk for engaging in maladaptive exercise. Based on deviance regulation theory, weight bias was examined as a potential moderator of the association between exercise identity and both excessive exercise and muscle-building behaviors. Design The current study is a secondary analysis of a larger data set investigating associations between athletic identity, exercise behaviors, and disordered eating behaviors. Hypotheses were examined using moderation testing in multiple linear regression. Main outcome measures Participants (N~=~225, 50.2\% female) completed the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory as a measure of maladaptive exercise. Results Controlling for sex, age, athlete status, and body mass index, weight bias moderated the association between exercise identity and both excessive exercise and muscle-building behaviors. Among individuals with high exercise identity, higher weight bias was associated with increased maladaptive exercise behaviors. Conclusion Individuals with higher exercise identity and higher weight bias may be at greatest risk of engaging in maladaptive exercise. Preventive interventions for maladaptive exercise behaviors may consider targeting exercise identity and weight bias.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Maladaptive exercise relates to eating disorder (ED) pathology and impairment in clinical and non-clinical populations. At present, two different conceptualizations of maladaptive exercise are often studied in relation to ED pathology: compulsive exercise and exercise dependence. Compulsive exercise functions to avoid negative affect (e.g., guilt and anxiety) associated with not exercising, whereas exercise dependence is associated with tolerance to exercise benefits and avoidance of exercise withdrawal. At present, clinicians and researchers struggle to determine the most appropriate term for describing problematic exercise in individuals with ED pathology. This study aimed to directly compare these conceptualizations of maladaptive exercise in relation to severity of ED pathology. DESIGN: This study examined cross-sectional data. METHOD: Undergraduate participants (N =235, 78\% female) with elevated ED pathology completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Compulsive Exercise Test (CET), and Exercise Dependence Scale (EDS). Multiple linear regression analyses evaluated associations between EDE-Q and CET and EDS scores and dominance analysis determined which qualities of exercise were uniquely associated with EDE-Q scores. RESULTS: Results suggest that compulsive qualities of exercise, including exercise to control shape and weight and to avoid negative affect are more strongly associated with severity of ED pathology than qualities of exercise dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and researchers working with ED populations can benefit from prioritizing assessments that capture compulsive qualities of exercise. Additionally, these results suggest that interventions that effectively target other compulsive behaviors (e.g., exposure and response prevention) may be promising treatment options for problematic exercise in the context of EDs.},

Identifying these longitudinal associations can aid in discerning relationships among eating and anxiety disorders and point toward a mechanistic understanding of developmental psychopathology. This study investigated the prospective associations between parent-reported anxiety in mid-childhood (age 10) and child-reported ED behaviors and disorders in adolescence (at ages 14 and 16 years) in a population-based sample. Methods Participants were individuals enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population-based, prospective study of women and their children; 7,767 children whose parents provided data at age 10 were included in current analyses. An exploratory factor analysis identified latent anxiety factors at age 10, followed by a path analysis that evaluated associations between these factors and eating disorder symptoms and cognitions at age 14. Results Parent-reported anxiety symptoms at age 10 yielded 5 factors: obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms related to symmetry and checking (Factor 1); OCD symptoms associated with aversion to dirt and germs (Factor 2); physical anxiety symptoms (Factor 3); worries (Factor 4); and social phobia symptoms (Factor 5). Factors 3 and 4 showed the most consistent, positive associations with a range of ED symptoms at age 14. Factor 3 predicted diagnosis of bulimia nervosa by age 16 (OR = 1.11, p = .007), whereas Factor 4 predicted diagnoses of anorexia nervosa (OR = 1.10, p = .01) and disordered eating by age 16 (OR = 1.08, p = .001). Conclusions Results indicate that symptoms of generalized anxiety in middle childhood may predict adolescent-onset ED symptoms and ED diagnoses.},

We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between experiences of exercise and ED behaviors and cognitions in an adolescent, population-based sample. METHODS: Adolescents (n = 4,054) self-reported whether they exercised to control shape and weight (exercise for weight loss [EWL]), and, if so, whether they exercised even when injured, and whether exercise interfered with life functioning (driven exercise) at age 14 years, allowing delineation of three exercise-based groups: no-EWL, EWL, and driven exercise. Participants also reported ED cognitions at age 14 years along with other ED behaviors (fasting, purging, binge eating) at ages 14 and 16 years. Sex-stratified regression approaches were employed to examine relationships between these exercise categories at age 14 and ED behaviors and cognitions at ages 14 and 16. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, those in the driven exercise group, compared to the no-EWL group, consistently reported higher levels of ED cognitions and behaviors, with those in the EWL group also reporting higher levels of some ED cognitions and behaviors relative to the no-EWL group. Those in the EWL and driven exercise groups at age 14 also demonstrated a higher prospective likelihood of fasting (boys and girls) and purging (girls only) at age 16, relative to those in the no-EWL group at age 14. DISCUSSION: Results inform our understanding of EWL and driven exercise and the developmental timing of ED behaviors in adolescence and point toward the potential utility of targeted prevention for young people who report EWL.},

This study was a retrospective analysis of 199 inpatient hospital records of female patients (age M=20.6, S.D.=7.03) in the following diagnostic categories: AN (n=115, 58\%), BN (n=38, 19\%), and EDNOS (n=46, 23\%). Patients were also grouped by a median split into low- and high-level exercise categories based on their total amount of weekly exercise. No significant relationship was found between diagnosis and exercise category (high and low) or diagnosis and exercise type (total, aerobic, and strength exercise). This is valuable because exercise specialist may be a worthwhile addition to treatment teams working with all eating disorder diagnostic groups. The high-level exercisers showed significantly greater scores on the EAT [F(2,1,110)=5.117, P{$<$}.05] and weight preoccupation [F(1,1010)=4.861, P{$<$}.05] than the low-level exercise groups. There were significant relationships between total exercise and EAT (r=.354, P{$<$}.01), drive for thinness (r=.262, P{$<$}.01), and body dissatisfaction (r=.312, P{$<$}.001). Total aerobic exercise was significantly related to EAT (r=.352, P{$<$}.001), drive for thinness (r=.272, P{$<$}.01), and body dissatisfaction (r=.268, P{$<$}.01). Finally, total strength exercise was related to body dissatisfaction (r=.249, P{$<$}.05). A significant difference was found among exercise group and length of hospitalization [F(1,155)=14.384, P{$<$}.000]. The high-level exercisers were in treatment for 3 weeks longer than their low-level exercisers. A forced stepwise multiple linear regression was calculated to predict the length of hospitalization. At Step 1, diagnosis and Body Mass Index (BMI) on admission explained 27\% of the variance in length of inpatient hospitalization [F(4,154)=18.08, P{$<$}.004, r(2)=.273]. When two exercise variables were included, aerobic activity explained an additional 5\% of variance, whereas strength activity explained an additional 0.3\% of the variance. Three-fourths of the predictors explained significant components of the total 32\% variance. The present study demonstrates that patients with greater total exercise and a greater total aerobic exercise show a significantly greater drive for thinness and require a longer length of hospitalization. This association was not present with total strength exercise levels. Effective clinical methods to modify total aerobic exercise levels need to be determined with inpatient populations.},

Using data from 257 female undergraduates (aged 17-52 yrs), structural equation modeling revealed that the model accounted for 71\% of the variance in bulimic symptomatology. Results provide consistent support for the dual pathway model of bulimia nervosa. Body mass was positively related to perceived pressure for a thin body and BD. Perceived pressure was related to BD both directly and indirectly through IBI. Also, significant paths were found from BD to bulimic symptomatology through both dietary restraint and negative affect, and dietary restraint predicted negative affect. Prevention programs focusing on IBI, BD, restraint, and negative affect in middle schools could reduce the prevalence of bulimia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Purpose This study evaluated the prevalence and clinical significance of driven exercise (DE) in treatment-seeking youth. Methods Participants were 380 consecutive referrals to a pediatric eating disorder program (90.8\% female; M age=14.9{$\pm$}2.2). Spearman's rho correlations examined the relation between DE frequency, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Eating Disorders Examination (EDE) Global Severity scores. ANOVA compared those reporting only DE, only vomiting, or both DE and vomiting on the aforementioned measures. Results 51.3\% of participants (n=193) reported DE in the past 3months, with an average of 21.8 (SD=32.6) episodes. Frequency of DE was related to EDE global severity score (Spearman's rho=.46; p{$<$}.001) and BDI Total Score (Spearman's rho=.33; p{$<$}.001). Participants reporting both vomiting and DE had the highest EDE global severity and BDI total scores. Conclusions DE is associated with greater eating disorder and depressive symptomatology, especially when paired with vomiting. The findings highlight the importance of assessing for DE in youth presenting for eating disorder treatment.},

  abstract = {Obesity represents a major health problem in the United States and is associated with increased prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) disease risk factors. Physical activity (PA) and exercise training (ET) are associated with reduced CV risk, improved cardiometabolic risk factors, and facilitated weight loss through creating a negative energy balance. Clinicians need to counsel overweight and obese patients on how much PA/ET is needed to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance. This will help establish realistic expectations and maximize improvements in CV risk factors. Although the minimum guidelines for aerobic PA (150\,min of moderate or 75\,min of vigorous physical activity per week) can improve CV health, these levels are generally inadequate for clinically significant weight loss or weight maintenance without caloric restriction. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the role of ET to promote clinically significant weight loss and promote weight maintenance. In particular, we will evaluate the likelihood of weight loss from ET programs composed of aerobic training only, resistance training only and programs that combine diet and ET. We will also explore the role of PA in promoting short-term and long-term weight maintenance.},

  abstract = {Background. Clinical, epidemiological, and genetic findings support an overlap between eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety symptoms. However, little research has examined the role of genetics in the expression of underlying phenotypes. We investigated whether the anorexia nervosa (AN), OCD, or AN/OCD transdiagnostic polygenic scores (PGS) predict eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety symptoms in a large developmental cohort in a sex-specific manner. Methods. Using summary statistics from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium AN and OCD genome-wide association studies, we conducted an AN/OCD transdiagnostic genome-wide association meta-analysis. We then calculated AN, OCD, and AN/OCD PGS in participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to predict eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety symptoms, stratified by sex (combined N = 3212\textendash 5369 per phenotype). Results. The PGS prediction of eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety phenotypes differed between sexes, although effect sizes were small. AN and AN/OCD PGS played a more prominent role in predicting eating disorder and anxiety risk than OCD PGS, especially in girls. AN/OCD PGS provided a small boost over AN PGS in the prediction of some anxiety symptoms. All three PGS predicted higher compulsive exercise across different developmental timepoints [{$\beta$} = 0.03 (S.E. = 0.01) for AN and AN/OCD PGS at age 14; {$\beta$} = 0.05 (S.E. = 0.02) for OCD PGS at age 16] in girls. Conclusions. Compulsive exercise may have a transdiagnostic genetic etiology, and AN genetic risk may play a role in the presence of anxiety symptoms. Converging with prior twin literature, our results also suggest that some of the contribution of genetic risk may be sex-specific.},

This investigation examined the prevalence of exercise-dependence symptoms among 237 college undergraduates and the relationship of exercise-dependence symptoms to atypical and disordered attitudes toward eating. Women scored significantly higher than men on the Exercise Dependence Questionnaire's (EDQ) Exercise for Weight Control and Exercise for Health Reasons subscales, and the Dieting and Bulimia and Food Preoccupation subscales of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), and exhibited significantly more symptoms of exercise dependence than men. Number of exercise-dependence symptoms was significantly positively correlated with problematic attitudes toward eating. Dysphoric mood states, cognitive problems, craving for exercise, and other symptoms associated with abstinence from exercise were relatively common among women and significantly more prevalent than among men. Study findings suggest that women with clinical and subclinical eating disorders are at high risk for the development of exercise-dependence symptoms. Findings also supported the existence of primary and secondary exercise dependence.},
