The following code runs, in order, all of the R code in the 'R' folder. This Code: 

1. Prepares the analytic dataset
2. Prepares the tables for both general and exercise-specific descriptives
3. Prepares the data to be used for the transition models
4. Creates transition models and saves these in the models/ folder
5. Imputes data for use in the mixed-modeling analysis (Note - can take several hours)
6. Creates maladaptive exercise models (saved in models/) and specifies model output for use in tables (Note - can take several hours)
7. Creates exercise for weight loss models (saved in models/) and specifies model output for use in tables (Note - can take several hours)
8. Completes model comparisons for EWL models
